# player-tracker
A simple mod that adds one item: a compass that can cycle through online players and track them. Made because one did not exist for 1.7.10.


i wanted to add a feature to enable/disable tracking on certain players with a command (so i could use betterquesting with it)<br>
i cannot promise there won't be bugs<br>
also uses gtnh example mod as a base
